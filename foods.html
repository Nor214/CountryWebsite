        Filipino cuisine is a vibrant mix of sweet, sour, and savory flavors, famous for iconic dishes like Adobo (soy sauce & vinegar stew), tangy Sinigang (tamarind soup), crispy Lechon (roast pig), rich Kare-Kare (oxtail in peanut sauce), sizzling Sisig (chopped pork), and savory noodle dishes like Pancit, plus sweet treats like Halo-Halo shaved ice. It blends indigenous ingredients with Spanish, Malay, and Chinese influences, often served with rice.
